When learning a language for the first time I always like to start with a calculator to get a hang of the basics and syntax.

This is a simple CLI Calculator.

**macOS/Windows**

Copy (src/calculator.c) and compile it to run on your OS.

**Linux**

If you're on Linux, you can just clone the repository with git and build.

    - Building:

        inside terminal run: make calculator

    - Dependencies:

        gcc
        make
        git

***NOTE:*** *this readme applies to both branches (master / linux-kernel-style)*

**Thank You!**
